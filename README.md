# OpenWeatherMap Demo App

## Description
A staightforward Node/Express demo app originally made as an application for [Massless Technologies](http://www.masslesstech.ca). 

## Usage
- `npm install`
- Put your OpenWeatherMap API key in `settings.json` 
- `npm start`
- Access from http://localhost:3000/
- Allow HTML5 geolocation access in your browser

## Comments
This app is more complex than it absolutely needs to be, there's no doubt. However, I took the opportunity to familiarize myself with webpack, build scripts, and  modern Node development in general.
